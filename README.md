# Codsoft Data Science Internship

# Introduction

I am thrilled to share my journey during the Codsoft Data Science Internship, where I had the opportunity to work on three exciting projects that delved into different aspects of data science. 
This internship has been an invaluable learning experience, and I am excited to showcase the results of my hard work.

# Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

In the first task, 
I explored the classic Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. 
Leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques, 
I aimed to uncover patterns and factors influencing survival rates. 
My approach and code for this task can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/NIRAJ-JAISWAR/TITANIC-SURVIVAL-PREDICTION.git).
